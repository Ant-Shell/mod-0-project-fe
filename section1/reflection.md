## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I would say somewhere in between. In my career so far, I had a tendancy to wait too long to ask a question - much to my detriment. Other times, I would ask too quickly, without researching the issue thouroughly enough.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

The data types learned about are as follows:
String - A variable number of characters, surrounded by quotes.
Number - A numberical character which is not surrounded by quotes. This includes floating point numbers (decimals). 
Boolean - An evaluation which equates to either True or False.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

`console.log(`"Hello World"`)`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

The characters are `//` or `/* */`. The purpose of a code comment are to leave human readible notes that will not be included in the scripting.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is a container that stores a kind of data for use at a later time. Kind of like a bottle can hold water for drinking at a later time.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

```num = number
isLoggedIn = boolean
name = string
```

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is joining separate values to create a new value.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

I think developers would use concatenation to create new output values based on user input. For example:

```var userName = window.prompt("Please enter your name: ");
alert("Hello, " + userName + ", it's great to meet you!");
````

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

No further questions at this time.
