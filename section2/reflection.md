## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- When seeing mistakes as critical to learning, you won't feed discouraged when you make one.
- From the perspective of a growth mindset, seeking help is a strength, not a weakness.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
- I feel that if there is something I don't understand, I keep working at it until I do.
- However, I have historically been rather stubborn when it comes to asking for help. My goal is to ask for help when I need it in a timely manner.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
 - This made me feel ok. I felt comfortable looking through notes to refresh my memory, which I feel helped support my learning.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
- A conditional statement is used to instruct a computer on the decision to make when some conditions are provided. These decisions are carried out, depending on if the previous conditions are true or false.
- An example of a daily life conditional is: If it is snowing outside, I will shovel the snow; else I will go for a walk.
- A conditional in a web application may include: If the user is logged in, show profile; else prompt user to create and account.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how the program reads them and determines what to do.
- Multiple conditionals are added by first having an initial `if` statement, followed by the appropriate number of `else if` statements (which fire if/when the previous statements are false), then an `else` statement at the end (which is basically a "catch all", if/when all previous statements are false).

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
- Commenting out and running sections of code
- Testing different variable value combinations
- Using `if` `else if` and `else` to test various conditions

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
- None at this time.
