## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

+ This felt good; it's starting to feel better to explore various ways to answer questions.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

+ In a web or mobile application, a developer probably uses arrays to hold various items that a user has ordered, before purchasing them.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

+ An array method is a way to modify the contents of an array, by adding, removing or moving around elements.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

+ The purpose of a loop is to keep doing an action until a certain condition is met. A loop may be used in conjunction with an array when printing a message based on the element value vs. simply printing a message a certain number of time

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

+ Loops make it so you don't something over and over; if you code it instead the computer will do it for you!

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

+ Not at this time
