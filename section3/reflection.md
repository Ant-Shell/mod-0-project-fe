# Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

+ This felt good; it's starting to feel better to explore various ways to answer questions.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

+ In a web or mobile application, a developer probably uses arrays to hold various items that a user has ordered, before purchasing them - like in a shopping cart.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

+ An array method is a way to modify the contents of an array, by adding, removing or reordering elements.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

+ The purpose of a loop is to keep doing an action until a certain condition is met. For example, a loop may be used in conjunction with an array when logging a message based on its element value/location vs. logging a message with a statement over and over.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

+ Loops make it so you don't have to do the same action over and over. If you code it properly instead, the computer will do it for you!

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

+ None at this time.
